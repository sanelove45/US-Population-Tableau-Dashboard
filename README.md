# Volcano-Eruption-Tableau-Dashboard

Here I have created a Tableau Dashboard on Volcano Eruption.

Following charts are used in Dashboard:
1) Bar Chart
2) Line Chart
3) Heat Map
4) Donut Chart
5) Symbol Map

Also I have used 2 KPI for:
1) Count Distint on Volcano Names.
2) Count Distint on Tec Measure.

And all charts are connected to each other so we can filter out the Volcano Eruption Data By using Country and Region Filters.
